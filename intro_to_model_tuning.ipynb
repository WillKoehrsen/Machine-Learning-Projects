    "# Introduction: Hyperparameter Tuning using Grid and Random Search\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore two methods for hyperparameter tuning a machine learning model. [In contrast](https://machinelearningmastery.com/difference-between-a-parameter-and-a-hyperparameter/) to model __parameters__ which are learned during training, model __hyperparameters__ are set by the data scientist ahead of training and control implementation aspects of the model. The weights learned during training of a linear regression model are parameters while the number of trees in a random forest is a model hyperparameter because this is set by the data scientist. Hyperparameters can be thought of as model settings. These settings need to be tuned for each problem because the best model hyperparameters for one particular dataset will __not be__ the best across all datasets. The process of [hyperparameter tuning (also called hyperparameter optimization)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter_optimization) means finding the combination of hyperparameter values for a machine learning model that performs the best - as measured on a validation dataset - for a problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "(__Quick Note__: a lot of data scientists use the terms _parameters_ and _hyperparameters_ interchangeably to refer to the model settings. While this is technically incorrect, it's pretty common practice and it's usually possible to tell when they are referring to parameters learned during training versus hyperparameters. I'll try to stick to using model hyperparameters or model settings and I'll  point out when I'm talking about a parameter that is learned during training. If you're still confused, [this article](https://machinelearningmastery.com/difference-between-a-parameter-and-a-hyperparameter/) may help you out!)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several approaches to hyperparameter tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Manual: select hyperparameters based on intuition/experience/guessing, train the model with the hyperparameters, and score on the validation data. Repeat process until you run out of patience or are satisfied with the results. \n",
    "2. Grid Search: set up a grid of hyperparameter values and for each combination, train a model and score on the validation data. In this approach, every single combination of hyperparameters values is tried which can be very inefficient!\n",
    "3. Random search: set up a grid of hyperparameter values and select _random_ combinations to train the model and score. The number of search iterations is set based on time/resources. \n",
    "4. Automated Hyperparameter Tuning: use methods such as gradient descent, Bayesian Optimization, or evolutionary algorithms to conduct a guided search for the best hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "(This [Wikipedia Article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter_optimization) provides a good high-level overview of tuning options with links for more details)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will implement approaches 2 and 3 for a Gradient Boosting Machine Learning Model. In a future notebook, we will implement automated hyperparameter tuning using Bayesian optimization, specifically the Hyperopt library. If you want to get an idea of how automated hyperparameter tuning is done, check out [this article](https://towardsdatascience.com/automated-machine-learning-hyperparameter-tuning-in-python-dfda59b72f8a). \n",

    "## Model: Gradient Boosting Machine \n",
    "\n",
    "The [Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)](https://machinelearningmastery.com/gentle-introduction-gradient-boosting-algorithm-machine-learning/) has recently emerged as one of the top machine learning models. The GBM is extremely effective on structured data - where the information is in rows and columns - and medium sized datasets - where there are at most a few million observations. We will focus on this model because it is currently the top performing method for most competitions on Kaggle and because the performance is highly dependent on the hyperparameter choices. The basics you need to know about the GBM are that it is an ensemble method that works by training many individual learners, almost always decision trees. However, unlike in a random forest where the trees are trained in __parallel__, in a GBM, the trees are trained __sequentially__ with each tree learning from the mistakes of the previous ones. The hundreds or thousands of weak learners are combined to make a single strong ensemble learner with the contributions of each individual learned during training using Gradient Descent (the weights of the individual trees would therefore be a model _parameter_). \n",
    "\n",
    "The GBM [has many hyperparameters to tune](http://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Parameters.html) that control both the overall ensemble (such as the learning rate) and the individual decision trees (such as the number of leaves in the tree or the maximum depth of the tree). It is difficult to know which combination of hyperparameters will work best based only on theory because there are complex interactions between hyperparameters. Hence the need for hyperparameter tuning: the only way to find the optimal hyperparameter values is to try many different combinations on a dataset!\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the implementation of the Gradient Boosting Machine in the [LightGBM library](http://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). This is a much faster (and some say more accurate) implementation than that available in Scikit-Learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details of the Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), check out this [high-level blog post](http://blog.kaggle.com/2017/01/23/a-kaggle-master-explains-gradient-boosting/), or this [in depth technical article.](https://brage.bibsys.no/xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/2433761/16128_FULLTEXT.pdf) \n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "With the necessary background out of the way, let's get started. For this notebook, we will work with a subset of the data consisting of 10000 rows. Hyperparameter tuning is extremely computationally expensive and working with the full dataset in a Kaggle Kernel would not be feasible for more than a few search iterations. However, the same ideas that we will implement here can be applied to the full dataset and while this notebook is specifically aimed at the GBM, the methods can be applied for any machine learning model. \n",
    "\n",
    "To \"test\" the tuning results, we will save some of the training data, 6000 rows, as a separate testing set. When we do hyperparameter tuning, it's crucial to __not tune the hyperparameters on the testing data__. We can only use the testing data __a single time__ when we evaluate the final model that has been tuned on the validation data. To actually test our methods from this notebook, we would need to train the best model on all of the training data, make predictions on the actual testing data, and then submit our answers to the competition.

    "# Cross Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate each combination of hyperparameter values, we need to score them on a validation set. The hyperparameters __can not be tuned on the testing data__. We can only use the testing data __once__ when we evaluate the final model. The testing data is meant to serve as an estimate of the model performance when deployed on real data, and therefore we do not want to optimize our model to the testing data because that will not give us a fair estimate of the actual performance. The correct approach is therefore to use a validation set. However, instead of splitting the valuable training data into a separate training and validation set, we use [KFold cross validation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIgfjmp-4BA). In addition to preserving training data, this should give us a better estimate of generalization performance on the test set than using a single validation set (since then we are probably overfitting to that validation set). The performance of each set of hyperparameters is determined by Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve (ROC AUC) from the cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will use 5-fold cross validation which means training and testing the model with each set of hyperparameter values 5 times to assess performance. Part of the reason why hyperparameter tuning is so time-consuming is because of the use of cross validation. If we have a [large enough training set, we can probably get away with just using a single separate validation set](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/deep-neural-network/train-dev-test-sets-cxG1s), but cross validation is a safer method to avoid overfitting. \n",
    "\n",
    "To implement KFold cross validation, we will use the LightGBM cross validation function, `cv`, because this allows us to use a critical technique for training a GBM, early stopping. (For other machine learning models where we do not need to use early stopping, we can use the Scikit-Learn functions `RandomizedSearchCV` or `GridSearchCV`.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Early Stopping\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important hyperparameters in a Gradient Boosting Machine is the number of estimators (the number of decision trees trained sequentially). We could set this as another hyperparameter in our search, but there's a better method: [early stopping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_stopping). Early stopping means training until the validation error does not decrease for a specified number of iterations. In the case of the GBM, this means training more decision trees, and in this example, we will use early stopping with 100 rounds, meaning that the training will continue until validation error has not decreased for 100 rounds. Then, the number of estimators that yielded the best score on the validation data will be chosen as the number of estimators to use in the final model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of early stopping is commonly applied to the GBM and to deep neural networks so it's a great technique to understand. This is one of many forms of regularization that aims to improve generalization performance on the testing set by not overfitting to the training data. If we keep adding estimators, the training error will always decrease because the capacity of the model increases. Although this might seem positive, it means that the model will start to memorize the training data and then will not perform well on new testing data. The __variance__ of the model increases as we continue adding estimators because the model starts to rely too heavily on the training data (high variance means overfitting).\n",
    "\n",
    "Early stopping is simple to implement with the LightGBM library in the cross validation function. We simply need to pass in the number of early stopping rounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of Cross Validation and Early Stopping \n",

    "## Hyperparameter Tuning Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have the basic framework in place: we will use cross validation to determine the performance of model hyperparameters and early stopping with the GBM so we do not have to tune the number of estimators. The basic strategy for both grid and random search is simple: for each hyperparameter value combination, evaluate the cross validation score and record the results along with the hyperparameters. Then, at the end of searching, choose the hyperparameters that yielded the highest cross-validation score, train the model on all the training data, and make predictions on the test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Four parts of Hyperparameter tuning\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Objective function: a function that takes in hyperparameters and returns a score we are trying to minimize or maximize\n",
    "2. Domain: the set of hyperparameter values over which we want to search. \n",
    "3. Algorithm: method for selecting the next set of hyperparameters to evaluate in the objective function.\n",
    "4. Results history: data structure containing each set of hyperparameters and the resulting score from the objective function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Switching from grid to random search to Bayesian optimization will only require making minor modifications to these four parts. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective function takes in hyperparameters and outputs a value representing a score. Traditionally in optimization, this is a score to minimize, but here our score will be the ROC AUC which of course we want to maximize. Later, when we get to Bayesian Optimization, we will have to use a value to minimize, so we can take $1 - \\text{ROC AUC}$ as the score. What occurs in the middle of the objective function will vary according to the problem, but for this problem, we will use cross validation with the specified model hyperparameters to get the cross-validation ROC AUC. This score will then be used to select the best model hyperparameter values. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to returning the value to maximize, our objective function will return the hyperparameters and the iteration of the search. These results will let us go back and inspect what occurred during a search. The code below implements a simple objective function which we can use for both grid and random search."

    "Some of these we do not need to tune such as `silent`, `objective`, `random_state`, and `n_jobs`, and we will use early stopping to determine perhaps the most important hyperparameter, the number of individual learners trained, `n_estimators` (also referred to as `num_boost_rounds` or the number of iterations). Some of the hyperparameters do not need to be tuned if others are: for example, `min_child_samples` and `min_child_weight` both limit the complexity of individual decision trees by adjusting the minimum leaf observation requirements and therefore we will only adjust one. However, there are still many hyperparameters to optimize, and we will choose 10 to tune. \n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing a hyperparameter grid is probably the most difficult part of hyperparameter tuning: it's nearly impossible ahead of time to say which values of hyperparameters will work well and the optimal settings will depend on the dataset. Moreover, the hyperparameters have complex interactions with each other which means that just tuning one at a time doesn't work because when we start changing other hyperparameters that will affect the one we just tuned! \n",
    "\n",
    "If we have prior experience with a model, we might know where the best values for the hyperparameters typically lie, or what a good search space is. However, if we don't have much experience, we can simply define a large search space and hope that the best values are in there somewhere. Typically, when first using a method, I define a wide search space centered around the default values. Then, if I see that some values of hyperparameters tend to work better, I can concentrate the search around those values. \n",
    "\n",
    "A complete grid for the 10 hyperparameter is defined below. Each of the values in the dicionary must be a list, so we use `list` combined with `range`, `np.linspace`, and `np.logspace` to define the range of values for each hyperparameter. "

    "One aspect to note is that if `boosting_type` is `goss`, then we cannot use `subsample` (which refers to training on only a fraction of the rows in the training data, a technique known as [stochastic gradient boosting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting#Stochastic_gradient_boosting)). Therefore, we will need a line of logic in our algorithm that sets the `subsample` to 1.0 (which means use all the rows) if `boosting_type=goss`. As an example below, if we randomly select a set of hyperparameters, and the boosting type is \"goss\", then we set the `subsample` to 1.0."

    "The `boosting_type` and `is_unbalance` domains are pretty simple because these are categorical variables. For the hyperparameters that must be integers (`num_leaves`, `min_child_samples`), we use `range(start, stop, [step])` which returns a range of numbers from start to stop spaced by step (or 1 if not specified). `range` always returns integers, which means that if we want evenly spaced values that can be fractions, we need to use `np.linspace(start, stop, [num])`.  This works the same way except the third argument is the number of values (by default 100).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, `np.logspace(start, stop, [num = 100], [base = 10.0])` returns values evenly spaced on a logarithmic scale. According to the [the docs](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.logspace.html) \"In linear space, the sequence starts at $base^{start}$ (base to the power of start) and ends with $base ^{stop}$ \" This is useful for values that differ over several orders of magnitude such as the learning rate."

    "The learning rate domain is from 0.005 to 0.5. Using a logarithmic uniform distribution allows us to create a domain where there are as many values from 0.005 to 0.05 as from 0.05 to 0.5. In a linear space, there would be far more values from 0.05 to 0.5 because this represents a larger distance in linear space but in logarithmic space each of these two intervals is the same width because they are multiples of 10 of each other. (Think about going from 1 to 10 and then from 10 to 100. On a logarithmic scale, these intervals are the same size, but on a linear scale the latter is 10 times the size of the former). In other words, a logarithmic uniform distribution lets us sample more evenly from a domain that varies over several orders of magnitude. \n",
    "\n",
    "If that's a little confusing, perhaps the graph above makes it clearer. We can also do a sanity check to make sure the spacing is correct by counting the number of values in each interval."

The grid search method for finding the answer is to try all combinations of values in the domain and hope that the best combination is  in the grid (in reality, we will never know if we found the best settings unless we have an infinite hyperparameter grid which would then require an infinite amount of time to run).\n",

    "\n",
    "The code below shows the \"algorithm\" for grid search. First, we [unpack the values](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/packing-and-unpacking-arguments-in-python/) in the hyperparameter grid (which is a Python dictionary) using the line `keys, values = zip(*param_grid.items())`.  The key line is `for v in itertools.product(*values)` where we iterate through all the possible combinations of values in the hyperparameter grid one at a time.  For each combination of values, we create a dictionary `hyperparameters = dict(zip(keys, v))` and then pass these to the objective function defined earlier. The objective function returns the cross validation score from the hyperparameters which we record in the dataframe. This process is repeated for each and every combination of hyperparameter values. By using `itertools.product` (from [this Stack Overflow Question and Answer](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/171173/list-all-possible-permutations-from-a-python-dictionary-of-lists)), we create a [generator](http://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/generators.html) rather than allocating a list of all possible combinations which would be far too large to hold in memory.

    "Random search is surprisingly efficient compared to grid search. Although grid search will find the optimal value of hyperparameters (assuming they are in your grid) eventually, random search will usually find a \"close-enough\" value in far fewer iterations. [This great paper explains why this is so](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume13/bergstra12a/bergstra12a.pdf): grid search spends too much time evaluating unpromising regions of the hyperparameter search space because it has to evaluate every single combination in the grid. Random search in contrast, does a better job of exploring the search space and therefore can usually find a good combination of hyperparameters in far fewer iterations. \n",

    "As [this article](https://medium.com/rants-on-machine-learning/smarter-parameter-sweeps-or-why-grid-search-is-plain-stupid-c17d97a0e881) lays out, random search should probably be the first hyperparameter optimization method tried because of its effectiveness. Even though it's an _uninformed_ method (meaning it does not rely on past evaluation results), random search can still usually find better values than the default and is simple to run.\n",
    "\n",

    "This time we see hyperparameter values that are all over the place, almost as if they had been selected at random! Random search will do a much better job than grid search of exploring the search domain (for the same number of iterations). If we have a limited time to evaluate hyperparameters, random search is a better option than grid search for exactly this reason.\n",

    "### Stacking Random and Grid Search\n",
    "\n",
    "One option for a smarter implementation of hyperparameter tuning is to combine random search and grid search: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use random search with  a large hyperparameter grid \n",
    "2. Use the results of random search to build a focused hyperparameter grid around the best performing hyperparameter values.\n",

    "In a later notebook (upcoming), we will look at methods that use the past evaluation results to pick the next hyperparameter values to try in the objective function. These methods (including [Bayesian optimization](https://sigopt.com/static/pdf/SigOpt_Bayesian_Optimization_Primer.pdf)) are essentially doing what we would do in the strategy outlined above: adjust the next values tried in the search from the previous results. The overall objective of these _informed methods_ is to limit evaluations of the objective function by reasoning about the next values to try based on past evaluation results. These algorithms are therefore able to save time by evaluating more promising values of hyperparameters. This is a really cool topic and [Bayesian optimization](http://gpss.cc/gpmc17/slides/LancasterMasterclass_1.pdf) is fascinating so stay tuned for this upcoming notebook. "

I am currently running this script on the set of features for 500 iterations and will make the results public when they are available. \n",

We can print information to the command prompt, but this will grow cluttered after 1000 iterations and the results will be gone if we close the command prompt. A better solution (although not perfect) is to write a line to a csv (comma separated value) file on each iteration. Then, we can look at the file to track progress while the searching is running, and eventually, have the entire results saved when the search is complete.\n",

    "When you want to check the csv file, __do not open it in Excel while the search is ongoing__. This will cause a permission error in Python and the search will be terminated. Instead, you can view the end of the file by typing `tail out_file.csv` from Bash where `out_file.csv` is the name of the file being written to. There are also some text editors, such as notepad or Sublime Text, where you can open the results safely while the search is occurring. However, __do not use Excel to open a file that is being written to in Python__. This is a mistake I've made several times so you do not have to! "
